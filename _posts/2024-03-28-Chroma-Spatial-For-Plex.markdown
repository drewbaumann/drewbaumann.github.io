Today I am am finalizing the initial release of Chroma, a Plex client for the Apple Vision Pro. With it a user will be able to watch their content in a spatial environment, on a huge blown up screen in their home (or wherever they physically are). This is a project I have been working on for about a month now and I am excited to finally be able to share it with the world!
